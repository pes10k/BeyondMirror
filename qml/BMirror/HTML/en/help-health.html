<h1>Health</h1>
<p>The health widget, like all widgets, has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit button in the top right, which brings down the widget's configuration panel</li>
<li>Title of the widget is in the center top of the widget</li>
<li>Close button in the top left of the widget's window, which closes the widget</li>
<li>Draggability / positioning: By tapping and dragging on a non-input part of a widget, users can position it wherever they'd like on the device's face</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Health Widget displays information about a given user's weight over time, sleep over time, and their nutrition needs.
Each of these three sets of data are separated by a named tab, and just like with tab widgets on most platforms, tapping a new tab replaces the content in the middle of the display with information corresponding to the newly selected tab.
The weight and sleep information is provided through line charts.
The 'Weight' tab allows for changing the graphed time interval to be yearly, weekly or monthly using the radio buttons.

<p>
The Nutrition tab of the health widget differs from the other tabs in that, instead of displaying a single type of information in a chart, it displays information about several dietary / nutrition factors in a table.
For each tracked nutrition category (fat, sodium, protein, etc.) the device displays the amount your body consumed ('intake') and used ('consumed') in the previous 24 hours, along with a recommendation on how you should change your diet for optimum health.

BeyondMirror relies on a separate device to gather the displayed health information.
We assume that we will be able to connect to this device wirelessly.
Cliking the edit button bring up a list of all such health-data-collecting devices that can be found in the local area.
Users can indicate the source of health-data by selecting a device.
