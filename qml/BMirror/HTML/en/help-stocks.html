<h1>Stocks</h1>
<p>The stocks widget, like all widgets, has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit button in the top right, which brings down the widget's configuration panel</li>
<li>Title of the widget is in the center top of the widget</li>
<li>Close button in the top left of the widget's window, which closes the widget</li>
<li>Draggability / positioning: By tapping and dragging on a non-input part of a widget, users can position it wherever they'd like on the device's face</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Stocks widget displays a brief summary of recent activity on a user selected set of stocks.
The widget display shows, in a list format, each stock name, its performance for the day.
All information about watched stocks will be retrieved from an online service, such as Yahoo! finance.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a stock name brings up more detailed information on the stock.
Similar to the News Item Display, the new window that pops up is not a widget (it contains no configuration options, and is closed if the stock widget is closed).
Here, the additional information is the stock's performance over time.
</p>
<p>
Clicking the edit button for the Stock widget brings up a list of currently watched stocks, each with a '-' button on the right.  Tapping the '-' button removes the stock from the list of stocks being watched.
The user can add additional stocks to the set of stocks being followed by entering the name of a new stock in the text field on the bottom of the device and pressing '+'.
The mirror will immediately verify that the entered text matches a known stock and display an error message if that is not the case, so that the user can correct the issue as quickly as possible.
