<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>The twitter widget, like all widgets, has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit button in the top right, which brings down the widget's configuration panel</li>
<li>Title of the widget is in the center top of the widget</li>
<li>Close button in the top left of the widget's window, which closes the widget</li>
<li>Draggability / positioning: By tapping and dragging on a non-input part of a widget, users can position it wherever they'd like on the device's face</li>
</ul>
<p>The Twitter widget displays all the tweets of twitters that users are following.
Each tweet appears in its own row in the list, and the user can flip through the list of tweets using the same list-flick pattern used in lists throughout the application.
</p>
<p>Users can use the edit button to add / remove twitters they want to follow (see below).</p>
<p>
Clicking on the edit button on the Twitter widget brings down the Twitter widget's settings pane.
Here users will get a list of twitters they're currently following.
Each item in the list appears with a minus ('-') button to the right.
Clicking the minus button removes the twitter from the list of followed twitters.
The bottom of the list includes a text field with a plus / '+' button.
Users can add a new twitter by typing in the name of the twitter.
The device will then do a web search for the given term, find the first matching twitter, and then add that twitter to the list of twitters.
If the twitter has already been in the list, the widget will show error information 'the account has already exsits.'
