<h1>News</h1>

<p>The news widget, like all widgets, has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit button in the top right, which brings down the widget's configuration panel</li>
<li>Title of the widget is in the center top of the widget</li>
<li>Close button in the top left of the widget's window, which closes the widget</li>
<li>Draggability / positioning: By tapping and dragging on a non-input part of a widget, users can position it wherever they'd like on the device's face</li>
</ul>
<p>The news widget displays a list of items aggregated from RSS feeds.
By default the widget shows news from the local area (using geolocation from the wireless connection and a service like Google or Yahoo news).
Clicking on a headline displays the full news story in a separate window</p>
<p>Advanced users can use the edit button to add / remove / edit news sources (see below).</p>
<p>
As with all widgets, clicking on the edit button on the News widget brings down the News widget's settings pane.
Here users will get a list of news feeds they're currently following.
Each item in the list appears with a minus ('-') button to the right.
Clicking the minus button removes the source from the list of followed feeds.
The bottom of the list includes a text field with a plus / '+' button.
Users can add new news by typing in a keyword.
The device will then do a web search for the given term, find matching news, and then add them to the list of news</p>
