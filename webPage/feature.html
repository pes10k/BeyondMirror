            <h2>Log In and Initial Configuration</h2>
			<h3>Scan Finger</h3>
            <p>Our design of sercurity log in is to read users' finger marks.
			When the BeyondMirror is turned on, a floating finger image hints users to scan their fingers in order to log into BeyondMirror.
			</p>
			<P>In the real application, we hava an entry box which allows users to input integers simulating the finger scanning log in. Once users have input an integer, users can click "Next" button for further process.</P>
			<h3>Select Language</h3>
			<p>The first time users turns on the device (and every subsequent time BeyondMirror is turned on until it has been configured), users are presented with brief, three step initial configuration process.  
			The first step is for users to select their preferred language.  
			The supported languages appear in a list users can scroll through them.
			Selecting a language updates all interface text immediately.
			Once users have selected their preferred language, they can click "next" button for further process.</p>
			<h3>Configure Wireless</h3>
			<p>The next step is to configure the device's wireless connection.
			All automatically detected wireless networks will appear in a list.
			If the user would prefer to connect to a wireless network that is not broadcasting their SSID,
			they can enter the name of the preferred network in the text field labeled 'Other network name'.
			Once the user has selected the network they would like to connect the mirror to,
			they will need to input the wireless network password.
			Once all fields have been filled, the device will attempt to connect to the network to verify the settings are correct.
			</p>
			<h3>Save Account</h3>
			<p>In the save account configuration step, users can click "No' button to log into BeyondMirror as a guest.
			   If user click "Yes" button to log in, BeyondMirror will keep user's setting and preference for future log in</p>

            <h2>Widgets</h2>
			<h3>News</h3>
			<p>The news widget displays a list of items aggregated from RSS feeds.
				By default the widget shows news from the local area (using geolocation from the wireless connection and a service like Google or Yahoo news).
				Clicking on a headline displays the full news story in a separate window</p>
			<p>Advanced users can use the edit button to add / remove / edit news sources (see below).</p>
			<p>
As with all widgets, clicking on the edit button on the News widget brings down the News widget's settings pane.
Here users will get a list of news feeds they're currently following.
Each item in the list appears with a minus ('-') button to the right.
Clicking the minus button removes the source from the list of followed feeds.
The bottom of the list includes a text field with a plus '+' button.
Users can add new news by typing in a keyword.
The device will then do a web search for the given term, find matching news, and then add them to the list of news</p>
			<h3>Twitter</h3>
			<p>The Twitter widget displays all the tweets of twitters that users are following.

The Health Widget displays information about a given user's weight over time, sleep over time, and their nutrition needs.
Each of these three sets of data are separated by a named tab, tapping a new tab replaces the content in the middle of the display with information corresponding to the newly selected tab.
The weight and sleep information is provided through line charts.
The 'Weight' tab allows for changing the graphed time interval to be yearly, weekly or monthly using the radio buttons.
</p>
<p>
The Nutrition tab of the health widget differs from the other tabs in that, instead of displaying a single type of information in a chart, it displays information about several dietary / nutrition factors in a table.
For each tracked nutrition category (fat, sodium, protein, etc.) the device displays the amount your body consumed ('intake') and used ('consumed') in the previous 24 hours, along with a recommendation on how you should change your diet for optimum health.
<p>
BeyondMirror relies on a separate device to gather the displayed health information.
We assume that we will be able to connect to this device wirelessly.
Cliking the edit button bring up a list of all such health-data-collecting devices that can be found in the local area.
Users can indicate the source of health-data by selecting a device.
</p>
			<h3>Video</h3>

The Video Widget allows users to play video files in the mirror.
The media files are broken down into relevant subcategories (Movies, TVshows, Podcasts).

Once a user has located a piece of media they want to play, the user can tap the name of the video and it will begin to play in a separate window.
</P>
<p>
Once a user has selected a media file to play, a separate, non-configurable window will open next to the relevant widget.
